I'm gonna tell you something that'll burn your ear<br><br>

Hip, hop, the hip hop hap<br>
I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap<br><br>

I was born on the 7th of May<br>
I remember very well that awful day<br>
I was in my mother, curled up tight<br>
Though I have to say it was as dark as night<br>
Nothing to do, didn't want to breathe<br>
I was so happy didn't want to leave!<br><br>

Then I hear some people give a shout:<br>
One push, Mrs. Rosen, and he'll be out!<br>
I'm tellin' you, that was a puzzle to me!<br>
I shouted out: "How'd you know I'm a he?"<br>
The doctor shouted "Good Lord, he can talk!"<br>
I popped out my head and said, "Now watch me walk."<br>
I juked and jived around that room<br>
Balam bam boola, balam de ditty boom<br><br>

Hip, hop, the hip hop hap<br>
I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap<br><br>

When I was one, I swam the English Channel<br>
When I was two, I ate a soapy flannel<br>
When I was three, I started getting thinner<br>
When I was four, I ate the dog's dinner!<br>
When I was five, I was in a band playing drums<br>
When I was six, I ate a bag of plums!<br>
When I was seven, I robbed a bank with my sister<br>
When I was eight, I became Prime Minister!<br>
When I was nine, I closed all the schools<br>
When I was ten, they made me King of the Fools<br><br>
